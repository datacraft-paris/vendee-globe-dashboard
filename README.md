# Vendee Globe Dashboard : Data Visualization Projects

In this repository, you will build a real-time dashboard connected to the previous API you have developed.

## Choose Your Project

For this exercise, we suggest you pick, based on the data present in the API (refer to the pydantic or SQLAlchemy schemas and descriptions), your own dashboard idea to develop.

In order to finish on time, we suggest you work your way gradually, here is some subjects suggestions, along with their complexity level one can explore:

| Complexity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| easy | A dashboard that displays the first skipper distance to finish (DTF) in real time |
| medium | A dashboard that displays live podium, along with information such as top-3-skipper DTF |
| hard | A live map (plotly) displaying boat position in real time |

If you want to build your dashboard in Python, we recommend `streamlit`.

We also encourage participants to try building with JS frameworks, AI can help you go a long way in building it.
There are also specialized tools such as:
- Lovable
- v0.dev
- bolt.new
